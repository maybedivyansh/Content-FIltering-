                </header>

                <div class="article-content">
                    <p>I've worked at three different Silicon Valley startups, and I've seen the ugly truth behind the "high-performance team" myth. The reality is that most companies are built on exploitation, burnout, and broken promises.</p>

                    <h2>The Startup Cult Mentality</h2>
                    <p>Silicon Valley startups operate like cults. They use psychological manipulation to convince employees that working 80-hour weeks for below-market pay is somehow a privilege. "We're changing the world," they say, while actually just building another app to sell ads.</p>

                    <p>I worked at a company where the CEO would give inspirational speeches about "mission" and "purpose" while simultaneously laying off 20% of the workforce every quarter. The remaining employees were expected to pick up the slack and be grateful for their jobs.</p>

                    <blockquote>"If you're not willing to sacrifice everything for the company, you're not a team player," the VP of Engineering told me when I asked for reasonable working hours.</blockquote>

                    <h2>The Layoff Cycle</h2>
                    <p>Silicon Valley has normalized mass layoffs as a business strategy. Companies hire aggressively during good times, then fire thousands of people when the market turns. The executives who make these decisions walk away with millions while employees lose their homes.</p>

                    <p>I've been laid off twice in my career, both times with no warning and no severance. The first time, I found out via a company-wide email at 9 AM on a Monday. The second time, my access to company systems was cut off before I even knew what was happening.</p>

                    <p>These layoffs aren't about performance or necessity. They're about pleasing investors and maintaining stock prices. Human lives are treated as disposable assets on a balance sheet.</p>

                    <h2>The Equity Scam</h2>
                    <p>Startups lure employees with promises of equity and stock options, but most of these promises are worthless. I've worked at companies where employees were given stock options that would be worth millions—if the company ever went public or was acquired.</p>

                    <p>But here's the catch: most startups fail, and even successful ones often dilute employee equity to the point where it's worth nothing. I know people who worked for years at startups, only to walk away with nothing when the company was sold.</p>

                    <p>The executives and investors always get paid, but the employees who actually built the product are left with worthless paper.</p>

                    <h2>The Diversity Theater</h2>
                    <p>Silicon Valley companies love to talk about diversity and inclusion, but it's mostly performative. I've worked at companies that would hire one woman or person of color for a leadership position, then use that hire to claim they're "diverse" while the rest of the company remains overwhelmingly white and male.</p>

                    <p>These token hires are often set up to fail, given impossible tasks with no support, then blamed when they don't succeed. It's a way for companies to claim they're progressive while actually maintaining the status quo.</p>

                    <p>The real diversity problem isn't about hiring—it's about creating environments where people from different backgrounds can actually succeed and advance.</p>

                    <h2>The Burnout Culture</h2>
                    <p>High-performance teams are often just teams of burned-out people who are too afraid to speak up. I've worked with brilliant engineers who were working themselves to death, afraid that if they slowed down, they'd be replaced by someone younger and cheaper.</p>

                    <p>The "move fast and break things" mentality has created a culture where quality and sustainability are sacrificed for speed. Teams are expected to ship features faster than is humanly possible, leading to technical debt and mental health issues.</p>

                    <p>I've seen people have nervous breakdowns, develop substance abuse problems, and destroy their relationships because of the pressure to perform at impossible levels.</p>

                    <h2>The Age Discrimination</h2>
                    <p>Silicon Valley is obsessed with youth. Companies prefer to hire recent graduates who will work long hours for lower pay, rather than experienced professionals who know how to build sustainable systems.</p>

                    <p>I've been in interviews where I was asked if I could "keep up with the young developers" or if I was "too old to learn new technologies." I'm 40, not 80. The industry's obsession with youth is hurting both employees and companies.</p>

                    <p>Experienced developers are often passed over for promotions in favor of younger, less experienced people who are willing to work longer hours. This creates a cycle where valuable knowledge and experience are lost.</p>

                    <h2>The Real Lessons</h2>
                    <p>After working in Silicon Valley for over a decade, here's what I've actually learned about building good teams:</p>

                    <p>1. Treat people like human beings, not resources. Respect their time, their boundaries, and their lives outside of work.</p>
                    <p>2. Pay people fairly and provide job security. Equity promises are worthless if the company fails.</p>
                    <p>3. Focus on sustainable productivity, not unsustainable speed. Quality takes time.</p>
                    <p>4. Value experience and wisdom, not just energy and novelty.</p>
                    <p>5. Create environments where people can speak up without fear of retaliation.</p>

                    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
                    <p>Silicon Valley's "high-performance team" model is built on exploitation and unsustainable practices. The companies that actually succeed in the long term are the ones that treat their employees like human beings, not disposable assets.</p>

                    <p>If you're working at a startup, protect yourself. Don't sacrifice your health, your relationships, or your financial security for promises that may never materialize. Set boundaries, demand fair compensation, and be prepared to walk away if the company doesn't respect you.</p>

                    <p>And remember: you're not building the future of humanity. You're building software. Don't let anyone convince you that your job is more important than your life.</p>
